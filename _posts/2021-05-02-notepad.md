Idea:
- 第三人稱射擊
- Symmetric design (player character ability == AI character ability); or asymetric?
- 2-week tournament loop:
  - human challengers + game_i + AI_i => produce data_i
  - game_i + AI_i + data_i => produce game_i+1 + AI_i+1
  - repeat
- Question: how does state-of-the-art AI perform in third person shooter game?

Illusion of intelligence / interesting AI: (http://www.gameaipro.com/GameAIPro2/GameAIPro2_Chapter33_Infected_AI_in_The_Last_of_Us.pdf)
- The best way to achieve these goals is to make our characters not stupid before making them smart. Characters give the illusion of intelligence when they are placed in well thought-out setups, are responsive to the player, play convincing animations and sounds,
and behave in interesting ways. Yet all of this is easily undermined when they mindlessly run into walls or do any of the endless variety of things that plague AI characters. Not only does eliminating these glitches provide a more polished experience, but it is amazing how
much intelligence is attributed to characters that simply don’t do stupid things.
- Communicating the intent of the characters to the
player is vital. We rejected some game features simply because they could not be communicated well.

1. Ghostrunner: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L36bOWZeV54 狀態空間大
2. Dark Soul 方向可以參考隻狼
3. 第一步是拿到錢，所以要 sell 創投
4. 看 Silicon Valley
5. 有價值的 NFT 會是名人去玩的錄像，就算玩的不怎麼樣 (e.g. 高中聯賽某不知名球員花式灌籃，不及 kobe 的一次單純灌籃能引起注意力) 想像 PewDiePie 來玩。

1. 像 Fortnite 變數太多，需要非常多資源 (訓練機器、錢)
2. 找遊戲加速器，SC-II 和 DeepMind 合作時有專門開發加速器
3. RL 要強就要多台機器跑 auto tune，耗電耗錢
4. https://www.youtube.com/c/OptimumTech/videos 頻道主很愛玩 FPS
5. 多看 paper；看怎麼開始做 proof of concept

想法：
1. 重點不在 AI 打贏人類，而是 AI 帶來多樣的挑戰性和趣味性，即「娛樂」與「教育/訓練」效果。
2. AI 可以在人類玩家甲的行為中抽取行為模式，表現給人類玩家乙看；當人類玩家玩法眾多，交互授粉的結果導致趣味性。=> 此趣味性僅限於人類玩家可表現的行為空間，並不包含例如聲音；AI 若在 stealth 時小聲哼流行旋律，肆無忌憚的暴露位置，肯定很有趣，但因人類玩家 PC 操作基本上沒有輸入語音，AI 可能無法從人類玩家身上學到。
3. 找 AI 科學家加入團隊；理想是「求知慾作為存在的基本動力」的人。
4. third-person game 可以讓 AI 「看見」自己的樣子，即 digital embodiment => 有助 ego 的形成？
5. 或許可以建立某種多個 AI 與人互動的情境，藉由觀察人選擇和哪位 AI 進行更長時間的互動來歸納受歡迎的行為模式，即構成 interestingness 信號的一種。
6. 人類設計師設計多種「interestingness critic persona model」作為 "discriminator"，和 RL "behavior generator" 共同訓練。
7. 初期的實作肯定是我做。先建立 UE4 基本概念、配合 tensorflow-ue4 做一個由 RL policy 控制的小遊戲。
8. 研究方向之一為："machine creativity" (Trent 博班期間的研究領域)

Interesting ideas:
- https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/3ojwl8/how_to_make_a_third_person_shooter_more_tactical/ : I think that your question is a bit too narrow. When it comes to a tactical game, I generally think of it as several factors: 1. Low execution costs. Things are not hard to do once you decide to do them. 2. High rate of information flow. You have the ability to know everything you need to know to solve any given problem. In that context, I wouldn't bother trying to solve the cover vision problem. Heck, I would go even further, maybe give the player an ability to see through walls so they can scope out their enemies while in cover (this is why so many recent stealth games have some variation of wallhack vision). 3. Many different options to juggle from. Opportunity costs everywhere. So if I were trying to make a tactical TPS, I think I would want to try playing with cover. Maybe cover is constantly moving, or cover is destructible, or you can strengthen/weaken cover spots. Watch Dogs had the cool thing where you can hack solar panels to tilt up and give you cover, what if you could hack your enemy's cover to remove it or something.

- https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/mzt5xm/why_i_dislike_rockstars_game_design/ : Rockstar's games usually try to be two completely different things simultaneously: a sandbox style open world that attempts to give the player as much freedom as possible, and a dense, linear cinematic story. I will use red dead 2 as an example, but with how much time and effort went into crafting the story, it was just ruined for me by the pacing. With any film, pacing is crucial, and when you want the player to go out and explore to their heart's content, they are effectively putting your movie on "pause" and just messing around until they decide to come back to it But by then, whatever momentum in the story that was building is gone, and in my case, I have to try to remind myself what happened so I can understand what I'm doing. No doubt Rockstar has been a highly influential force in the industry and largely paved the way for all the open world games that currently dominate the single player market, but I feel like the way you tell the story should be a reflection of the gameplay. They should logically work together. I would rather just see a more simplified story where the player is given objectives that they can approach however they want. I think that's a major reason botw works so well in an open world because of its simplistic story and characters. I don't feel like I'm putting the story on hold or having other characters just wait around for me 24/7. If you want to give players freedom with the gameplay, give them freedom with the story as well. (Also, yes, red dead 2 has an amazing story and characters, but like others have said, I think it would have worked better as a movie).
