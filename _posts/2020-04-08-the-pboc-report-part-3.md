This report by People Bank of China touched upon ideas and visions that resonate with my understanding of various ideas and projects in the Ethereum community (for completely different ends perhaps), thus I am motivated to translate it into English.

## The Synergy from the Marketization of Monetary Policy and the Research on Big Data Mechanism
Zou Pingzuo, chief researcher at People’s Bank of China

#### Question 2: How to solve for accurate, timely, and sufficient GDP statistics?

**My proposal is: explore marketized big data, analyze the process of GDP statistics formation at the micro scale, and construct a new univariate econometric model based on individual value function.**

The modern time calls for a new macroeconomic data industry, where modern information technology is fully leveraged to build a macroeconomic big data system that is real-time, dynamic, and accurate, and to transform the process of this ___________. The fourth plenary meeting of the nineteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China made it very clear that data is a mean of production and is involved in economic resource allocation in China. Large-scale macroeconomic models will be built on this foundation, solve for accurate and timely economic big data and achieve objectivity and timeliness in our monetary policy-making.

First, we shall construct the multivariate big data for GDP by considering the four sectors: households (families), businesses, governments and exports.
