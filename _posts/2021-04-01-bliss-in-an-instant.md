1 - There may be "natural" tendency to want to participate in building the "future", particularly for technologists. I found that I must differentiate the part of the self that wants to build future because it wants to escape the present from the part of the self that is drawn to the ever-evolving interestingness and rewarding challenges in the process of future-building. The second one is much purer. The first one is an attempt to indulge in imagination and run away from the current reality, which is detrimental to the day-to-day Freedom (see Kapil Gupta's work). There is of course another part of the self that believes there is massive wealth to be found in future-building, yet it is far less significant to me now.

2 - I still find it hard to believe, from heart, that my life will end. I however have grasped the useful concept that my life is only on lease (again, see Kapil Gupta's work). If only I could know the remaining time until my impending death. In this regard, I find taking walks in the cemetery useful.

3 - It has become increasingly obvious, and fascinating ever more so, that there is a chasm between knowledge and experience, yet their difference is so often obscured, such as by the ambiguity in conventional language patterns. Simply, the knowing of all physical and chemical properties of water lives in a completely different dimension from having drank water and experienced it; the former entertains the mind, while the latter quenches the thirst. In this regard, embarrassingly, a gargantuan portion of my life was focused on the attainment of knowledge. "The knowing of the head is for cocktail parties. The knowing in the heart is for transformation." (Kapil Gupta) The later comes from experience.
