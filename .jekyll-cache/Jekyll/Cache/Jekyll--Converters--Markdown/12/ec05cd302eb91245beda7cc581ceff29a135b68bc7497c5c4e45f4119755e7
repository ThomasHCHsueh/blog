<p>This report by People Bank of China touched upon ideas and visions that resonate with my understanding of various ideas and projects in the Ethereum community (for completely different ends perhaps), thus I am motivated to translate it into English and annotate it with my thoughts and references.</p>

<hr />

<p>The effectiveness of macroeconomic policy depends on the availability of quality information. However, as revolutionary technologies ushered in the Information Age, the traditional model of macroeconomic policy-making is impacted in the following ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>market failure + government failure, causing global economic unrest; (<em>when the market has access to more quality information than the government does, the latter will fail in regulating the economy</em>)</li>
  <li>the information explosion is challenging government’s capacity to regulate and assert control over the economy.</li>
</ol>

<p>On one hand, the abundance of information should help the government gauge the condition and needs of the society, thus improving its efficiency in policy implementation; one the other hand, without the capacity to discover and classify information by adapting its value functions and cost functions, the government will be buried in the increase of information entropy which it could not handle, chaos ensue and economies perish.</p>

<p>Simply put, in the Information Age, traditional economic theories and models are ineffective. The governments that fail to adapt quickly will see their countries and economies driven into crises.</p>

<p>2020 is a watershed year, where 2 frameworks are violently challenged by technological revolution:</p>
<ol>
  <li>the classical liberal monetary theory and the associated framework for monetary policy implementation;</li>
  <li>government-centered framework for monetary policy implementation.</li>
</ol>

<p>The entire world is now going through violent volatility as COVID-19 wreaked havoc, US presidential election approaches, the OPEC-Russia oil talk broke down, and China’s economy faces higher risk of downturn.</p>

<p>At this critical juncture, central banks around the world coordinate with the US to implement massive scale monetary policies, while the promise and grand narrative of digital currency gains popularity.</p>

<p>Let us examine the M2/GDP statistics of China:
