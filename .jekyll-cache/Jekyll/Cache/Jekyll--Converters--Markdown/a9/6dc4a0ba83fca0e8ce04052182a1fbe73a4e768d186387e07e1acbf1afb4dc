<p>This report by People Bank of China touched upon ideas and visions that resonate with my understanding of various ideas and projects in the Ethereum community (for completely different ends perhaps), thus I am motivated to translate it into English.</p>

<h2 id="the-synergy-from-the-marketization-of-monetary-policy-and-the-research-on-big-data-mechanism">The Synergy from the Marketization of Monetary Policy and the Research on Big Data Mechanism</h2>
<p>Zou Pingzuo, chief researcher at People‚Äôs
Bank of China</p>

<h4 id="question-1-is-the-gdp-number-reported-by-the-national-bureau-of-statistics-of-china-nbs-accurate">Question 1: Is the GDP number reported by the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS) accurate?</h4>

<p>This question touches the heart of macroeconomy policy making. According to research, the statistics reported by the NBS does not reflect the true GDP, wherein the error is considerably large. Due to country-to-country differences in their conditions, as well as the different bandwidth and coverage in statistics gathering, there is no value in comparing GDPs across different countries. The dogmatic application of traditional monetary policy model will result in clear monetary policy failure. Therefore, the statistics from the NBS shall not serve as the only data that drives policy making; we need to build big data model for GDP and implement marketization, fine-grain and dynamic data management.</p>

<p>Due to its important role in policy making, the measurement of GDP shall tolerate no compromise at all. In 2015, IMF predicted that we have approached the end of the American Era ‚Äî China‚Äôs GDP based on Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) will surpass the US in 5 years ‚Äî and that 2016 will be the first year of the Chinese Era. This statement was an atomic bomb to the western countries and fueled controversy. The western media voiced their doubt and anxiety. In reality, this conclusion was complete bullshit. The reason is that the PPP was derived from the chosen basket of goods, but the estimates of their true prices were erroneous. Currently the price of major agricultural produce and the price of durable consumer goods based on PPP in China are higher than the western countries. IMF‚Äôs conclusion is therefore invalid.</p>

<p>(<em>From my own research experience, I opined that IMF‚Äôs conclusion and methodology is inapplicable to China‚Äôs situation. I attended the training program designed for central bank senior managers and discovered that many of their research methodologies are completely inapplicable to China. For instance, IMF uses the Life-Cycle Hypothesis (LCH) extensively to analyze investments and savings, but they fail to recognize the unique tradition and economic structure of each country. Families are the basic building blocks of China‚Äôs economy, while the LCH assumes that individuals are the basic building blocks of an economy as is the case in the US among other developed countries. The life cycle curves of these two ___ are very different. China‚Äôs curve would like an upward linear trend, while the LCH‚Äôs one would look like a normal distribution. An obvious evidence is that savings rates in China and Southeast Asian countries are higher than that of western countries.</em>)</p>

<p>On the other side of the coin, we should acknowledge that China‚Äôs GDP has been grossly underestimated, which is an important aspect of the Chinese characteristics. That there is massive leakage in GDP statistics measurement should be recognized, otherwise government failure will become the norm, and decisions will always be made from grossly incomplete information.</p>

<p>(<em>China‚Äôs GDP has always been difficult to measure, primarily because of the particularity of China‚Äôs economy. China‚Äôs reported M2/GDP exceeds 200%, which obviously contradicts with the financial depth of China. M2, the nominator, is perhaps significantly overestimated due to problems in China‚Äôs financial system ‚Äî a system originated from a planned economy, where the financial market and currency market are underdeveloped such that direct finance dominates the scene of China‚Äôs financial system, causing a concentration of capital in the banking system, sometimes sitting idle even. And GDP, the denominator, is underestimated for many reasons. In recent years, the degree of GDP underestimation is reduced by the disappearance of many gray economies, which must have contributed to the decline in economic momentum. The deterioration of microeconomic environments leave millions of these small businesses to their own devices. This is perhaps the biggest loss invisible to China‚Äôs economy. They are the earth on which China‚Äôs economy develops.</em>)</p>

<p>Logically and empirically speaking, there are five angles to approach the problem of the underestimation of China‚Äôs GDP:</p>

<p>1 - The structure of China‚Äôs economy is very complicated. The building blocks are the families, and there are an abundance of centrally-owned and state-owned enterprise. There are a myriad of internal transactions ‚Äî a son working for his father without earning an income, income earned from the private plots allocated to an individual on a collective farm is not included in the calculation of GDP, and capital movements between centrally-owned and state-owned enterprises are counted as internal transactions as well.</p>

<p>2 - The degree of China‚Äôs marketization is far too low that a massive amount of products and services are not recorded into the transaction process because of obscure property rights, and therefore are not treated as commodity. The degree to which a country‚Äôs GDP can be measured is proportional to the degree of marketization of its economy. There are 3 aspects to this problem: 1/ a vast amount of intangible assets in China such as intellectual property, artworks and antiques lack clear demarcation of property rights, which forbids them from being traded; 2/ a vast amount of services such as legal and social services could not be commoditized; 3/ a vast amount of means of production such as farm lands lack clear demarcation of ownership, which forbids them from being traded.</p>

<p>3 - In China, the means of production are owned by the country, including land, mine property, and real property. The prices of these properties are bound to determine prices of goods produced, and are bound to be lower than the prices of privately owned assets.</p>

<p>(<em>Public ownership of means of production has significant influence over asset prices, both domestically and globally. We rarely see real estate companies in western countries purchase and develop land in China. Foreigners rarely purchase houses in China. Additionally, the meaning behind real property investment data in China is drastically different from that in the western countries, because in China the so called investment is only the purchase of right-of-use. Likewise, capital markets face difficulties in asset pricing because the net asset value of a public company represents merely a right-of-use and is primarily linked to the terms and duration of use.</em>)</p>

<p>4 - Massive amount of public goods are counted as investment, not consumption. The ways in which public goods are produced and consumed are drastically different from that in the western countries in 3 ways: 1/ The consumptions made by the massive government bodies and public institutions bear the property of public goods, including public servants‚Äô insurance, housing, meal, transportation, healthcare, traveling, entertainment, and fitness, which are partially or completely covered by the country; government offices are equipped with cafeterias, kindergartens, barber shops, hospitals, gyms and theaters. Housings are allocated centrally for public servants. 2/ Centrally-owned enterprises produce massive amount of public goods that are worth trillions of RMB every year, such as roads, parks, plazas, water facilities, and stadiums. 3/ The government provides a dominant portion of all services in the economy, including security, education, cultural and legal service. Its degree of commoditization is far lower than countries with market economy. The 2020 coronavirus pandemic highlights the sheer amount of public goods provided by centrally- and state-owned enterprises.</p>

<p>Public goods are usually counted as investment and not included in consumption. Thus, many economists asserted that there is a shortage of consumption in China and pushed for policies that encourage more consumption, leading to rising debt levels in families. We need to understand that a considerable portion of the Chinese society does not need to spend their earning to live. Therefore, both output-based and income-based GDP numbers are gross underestimations. The total volume of consumption is also grossly underestimated.</p>

<p>(<em>Today, housings are still allocated for public servants. Xinhua News Agency has exceptional cafeteria provided for free, where the quality of meal exceeds that of UK‚Äôs above average families. Thus, millions of people choose to take exams in hope of becoming public servants, which are often seen as the nobility class. Furthermore, officials are known to cover up for one another, and their families enjoy generational benefits from the government.</em>)</p>

<ol>
  <li>The statistics system in China is not well developed. There are numerous gray economies whose activities are not counted in GDP. Tax system does not serve as a validation of such statistics. Statistical errors are large, decisions are largely planned instead of data-driven and thus are less objective. The numbers reported by the NBS have little value. Aside from gray economies, there is actually a whole ‚Äúspectrum‚Äù of different economies between black and white.</li>
</ol>

<p>(<em>aa</em>)</p>

<p>In summary, GDP and M2 statistics is unique to each country and should be treated individually in analysis and application. In order to better measure its GDP, a country would have to gather statistics through a multitude of channels and revise it repeatedly.  In countries where tax system is rigorous, tax growth is an exceptional indicator due to its proximity with income-based GDP calculation. However, tax system is less rigorous in China and thus less valuable to the estimation of GDP.</p>

<p>GDP statistics that will drive monetary policies should satisfy the following properties:</p>
<ol>
  <li>output-based and income-based numbers should validate each other;</li>
  <li>national statistics and local statistics should validate each other;</li>
  <li>GDP statistics and tax indicators should validate each other;</li>
  <li>estimates at the macro and micro levels should validate each other;</li>
  <li>government‚Äôs statistics and market‚Äôs statistics should validate each other.</li>
</ol>
