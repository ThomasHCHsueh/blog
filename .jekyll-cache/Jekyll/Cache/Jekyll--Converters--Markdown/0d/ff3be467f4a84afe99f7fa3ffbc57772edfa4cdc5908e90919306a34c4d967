<p>This report by the People’s Bank of China touched upon ideas and visions that resonate with my understanding of various ideas and projects in the Ethereum community (for completely different ends perhaps), thus I am motivated to translate it into English.</p>

<h3 id="question-3-what-are-the-next-steps-for-the-central-bank-and-monetary-policy-of-china">Question 3: what are the next steps for the central bank and monetary policy of China?</h3>

<p>Step 1 should be prioritizing full employment via developing the private economy and incentivizing small and medium business creation by creating the best business environment and currency system in the world. Step 2 should be progressively building the marketization of accurate and dynamic economic data at the micro-scale to achieve the value creation function of our currency as well as surpass US in GDP per capita. Step 3 should be creating a currency system whose foundation is the economic values of the individuals, progressively achieving the maximization of individuals’ values as the goal of our scientific currency governance system.</p>

<p>In 2020, the economy and financial markets in China is faced with unprecedented challenge and uncertainty. Since the beginning of the year, the world has seen the widespread of COVID-19, the huge volatility in US and European stock markets, and the US stock market hitting its circuit breakers multiple times within a month. In response, US has implemented extremely expansionary monetary policies by reducing interest rate to zero and injecting 5 trillion dollars into the economy.</p>

<p>We shall consider the special risks China is faced with:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><span style="color:#0067FB">The expansionary US monetary policy likely induces risk at the global scale. Being the world reserve currency and driven by zero interest rate, the eventual oversupply of US dollar will spread across the world and buy up assets with good fundamentals at low prices, causing an aggregation of resources into the US, which forms a new era of US dollar supremacy.</span> In contrast, China will lose competitiveness at best and fall into a long-term suppression by the US in the global monetary system at worst. <span style="color:#0067FB">If at the same juncture US rolls out the digital US dollar by coordinating with Facebook’s Libra platform, the currency will dominate all cross-border payments. The resulting financial hegemony will be fatal to China.</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>China’s progress in globalization will be severely impeded by this financial attack from the US. Given US’s control over the global financial system, its financial attack would prove to be fatal to any other country. China should take aggressive precautions in trade settlement, currency system, and the new digital currency paradigm.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are three major internal risks in China. The Munich Security Conference this year has demonstrated the global anti-China rhetoric. With our increasingly open financial system, risk exposure to the global markets and politics grows. Besides, we are faced with unprecedented bottlenecks in developing our economic system and structure.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>(<em>The three major internal risks are the huge gap between the financial system and the real economy, the huge gap between the value and price of RMB, and the huge gap between house prices and the real income of the people. On the surface level, the Munich Security Conference reviewed the deficiencies of the western countries, but it is intended for creating strategies to contain the growth of China.</em>)</p>

<p>Considering the possibility of government failure, market failure, the external impacts, and the major internal risks, we could consider implementing the 3 following steps:</p>

<h4 id="step-1">Step 1</h4>
<p><span style="color:#0067FB">Prioritize full employment as the ultimate goal of our monetary policy. Full employment is an achievement toward the maximization of individuals’ economic values.</span> We have to focus on both the quantity and quality aspects of employment. As long as we can improve the economic value of our entire 1.4 billion population, we will no longer fear any external impact.</p>

<p>(<em>There are four goals of China’s monetary policy: economic development, full employment, price stability, balance of international payments. These four goals co-depend and counteract one another.</em>)</p>

<p>The traditional model of monetary policy usually focuses on economic growth targets and inflation targets. These targets are increasingly misleading due to the massive changes in our economy’s value function, production function and growth function. It will be an obvious mistake to try to control growth. Compounded by the uniqueness in China GDP statistics and M2 structure, we are prone to fall into statistics traps systemically and structurally, causing government failure.</p>

<p>(<em><span style="color:#0067FB">A big contribution to mankind of the information technology revolution is that individual’s value can be measured and managed accurately. This change in the value function will have profound influence on economic theories, finance theories, currency theories, and the research of human history and society. We shall recognize that the objective function of the economic growth function is the value of the individual, not the value of the commodity. The meaning of this transition is that of continuity. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has triggered this transition.</span></em>)</p>

<p>There is massive room for improvement in terms of China’s employment. By fully embracing the technological revolution, we stand to benefit from an institutional dividend surpassing the one we have enjoyed over the past 30 years of economic reform.</p>

<p>(<em>According to my research, China’s economy has 6 dividends to be realized: institutional dividend, labor dividend, technological dividend, resource dividend, globalization dividend and eco-systemization dividend.</em>)</p>

<h4 id="step-2">Step 2</h4>
<p><span style="color:#0067FB">Progressively build the marketization of accurate and dynamic economic data at the micro-scale to achieve the value creation function of our currency as well as surpass US in GDP per capita.</span></p>

<p>Our central banks now operate in the credit-based model, while the central bank of the future will operate in the value-based model. Since the advent of central banks, they are solely responsible for the issuance of currency while balancing the inflationary and deflationary forces. A good central bank would achieve the massive issuance of currency without creating uncontrollable inflations. Witnessing the rising US dollar index during the aggressive issuance of more US dollar proves that the US central bank is a massively successful central bank - it successfully sucks liquidity and value from global markets and economies like a vampire. We must be cognizant of the exploitative nature of the American monetary system and debunk it. The rise of China hinges on the advancement of our currency system and the promotion of the value of our currency.</p>

<p>(<em><span style="color:#0067FB">This value-sucking nature of the US dollar supremacy explains why countries in South America, Africa, the Middle East and the former USSR region are increasingly poor. The US confiscates the values of these countries for free via its currency system and the market mechanism. In reality, every country in the world is producing for the US.</span> But the current president of the US is not satisfied yet.</em>)</p>

<p><span style="color:#0067FB">Practically speaking, China’s central bank could purchase data from the big information technology and big data companies (Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, Xiaomi, Sugon, GC-Chain, OneConnect of Ping An Insurance etc) and create a highly flexible and agile “central nervous system”, which is capable of discovering, managing and creating value as well as dynamically regulate financial activities and effectively reduce financial risks and eradicate financial crises. In particular the system will be able to accurately gauge the financial risk exposure from the US.</span></p>

<p>(<em><span style="color:#0067FB">Our central nervous system now is predominantly implanted with US’s theories and systems. It is numb and inefficient. For instance, the reason why we cannot seem to make progress in solving the financing bottleneck for small and medium businesses is because the government and the markets are cut off from each other at the macro and micro scale.</span></em>)</p>

<p>More crucially, by transforming the process of currency issuance by the central bank into a process of value creation, we could reach US’s GDP per capita in 5 years, which results in China’s GDP being 3-4x of US’s GDP.</p>

<p>(<em>China should not set any “ideal GDP growth rate”, but has to set goals toward full employment and raising GDP per capita</em>)</p>

<h4 id="step-3">Step 3</h4>
<p><span style="color:#0067FB">Create a currency system whose foundation is the economic values of the individuals, thus theoretically and practically making significant contribution to China’s development and the whole mankind.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#0067FB">Both Monetarism and Keynesianism failed to recognize the potential value-creation function of the currency. Right now the currencies issued by countries worldwide do not possess this function.</span></p>

<p>(<em><span style="color:#0067FB">The upcoming DCEP is essentially still a credit-based currency and will only serve as a partial replacement of cash. It is the digitization of the fiat credit-based money and is not able to create value. This design is insufficient from the standpoint of the new value and currency system proposed in this essay and requires improvement.</span></em>)</p>

<p>Potentially, the blockchain-based individual value management industry will be the most lucrative industry of all in 5-10 years against the backdrop of the industrialization, marketization and globalization of the RMB. The Chinese economy could become the standard of all economies worldwide.</p>

<p>The propagation mechanisms in this new currency system include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Every individual’s economic value is defined and tracked in the blockchain-based super ledger. These values are congruent with the income and spending big data. These data become the foundation of the individual’s token, which circulates on the markets. The process from individual’s value to the token value is the operating process of digital currency.</li>
  <li>Every individual is able to sell the right to use his/her own time to the markets. This tradeable right is a blockchain-based token with timestamps and individual’s value attached to it.</li>
  <li><span style="color:#0067FB">The value creation function of the currency is realized, so that the need for balancing inflation and deflation is completely eliminated.</span></li>
  <li>Rigorous and scientific regulations will be created and implemented to prevent and eliminate any kind of risk.</li>
</ol>

<p>Fundamentally, this system rejects the current credit-based currency system led by the US dollar.</p>

<p>Not only is this system compatible with the social values of China, it realizes the universal ideology of achieving financial freedom of every individual, which could resolve the longstanding ideological conflicts between China and the western countries.</p>

<p>2020 is destined to be an extraordinary year and a huge turning point. The COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing. It has inspired us to rethink our value systems and recognize that we all look forward to further reformation of our theories, systems, markets and societies. <span style="color:#0067FB">We look forward to building a new theory, an innovative currency and economic system, and a new sovereign governance system</span>, a harmonic, healthy and secure global value system and shared future of mankind, where there is no pandemic, no currency war, no vampire-like hegemony, no economic sanctions and trade barriers. We look forward to building a new world.</p>
